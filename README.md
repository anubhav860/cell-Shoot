## Android 2-d Game

# Introduction to 2D gamming
2D games use flat graphics, called sprites, and don’t have three-dimensional geometry. They’re drawn to the screen as flat images, and the camera (orthographic camera) has no perspective.
2D games are also called Platform game. The word platform also describes that something held on a platform. Here the player can run, jump, shoot, collect powers on a platform. Since 2D games are flat, the environment created in the games is also visually flat. They do not focus much on the environment of the game.
